# Memory
<b> This project is a version of the memory game with React. </b> <br><br>
● The game consists of pairs of cards bearing identical illustrations. <br>
● All cards are shuffled and then spread face down on the table. <br>
● If the player turns over two identical cards, they remain turned over. <br>
● Otherwise, they are turned face down. The player has won when all cards have been turned over.

## What I learn in this project :
● Discovery of <b> React JS </b> <br>
● Discovery of <b> Components </b> <br>
● Discovery of <b> Hooks </b>

## My plan to build this project
● <b>Make a wireframe</b>, this one will us identify the different components and will facilitate the realization of the project. <br>
● Create components. <br>
